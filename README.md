## Introduction

We all love to code, that is why we are here – on the earth, no(!) on GitHub –
so this tool will make coding even more fun and will improve your work with
co-workers, friends and the world of coding!

Unibeautify formats your code on-the-fly and supports
[many languages](https://unibeautify.com/docs/languages) with plenty of options
so you can customize to meet your needs. You can be confident everyone who is
editing your code will leave it looking beautiful!

To fund the continued growth and development, Unibeautify will have paid
features like the Unibeautify-CI. But feel free to buy us a coffee or support us
on Patreon. <- what about that @glavin?

Unibeautify will have paid features like the Unibeautify-CI to fund the
continued growth and development.

## Features

* Single beautifier abstracting multiple beautifiers for
  [multiple languages](https://unibeautify.com/docs/languages)
* Unified beautifier
  [configuration options](https://unibeautify.com/docs/config-file)
* Automated beautification with
  [Unibeautify CI](https://unibeautify.com/docs/ci)
* Easy to set up with NPM
* Simple usage
* The old way through the [console window](#command-line-interface-cli)

## Installation

The installation for Unibeautify is super simple, just install it via the
[Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev unibeautify
```

or with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```shell
$ yarn add --dev unibeautify
```

### Command-line interface (CLI)

Unibeautify can also be run through a terminal of your choice with the
Command-line interface (CLI). Unibeautify CLI is an awesome tool if you love to
code and often use the Terminal to do things. To learn more about the
Unibeautify CLI go to:
[https://github.com/Unibeautify/unibeautify-cli](https://github.com/Unibeautify/unibeautify-cli)

> :warning: **Important:** We do not recommend using Unibeautify CLI with your
> Continuous Integration (CI) service, such as Travis CI. Instead, you should
> consider using [Unibeautify CI](https://github.com/apps/unibeautify-ci) which
> is a more optimized solution.

## How to use

To learn more about Unibeautify and how to use it, just have a look in our well
commented [examples](examples/).
